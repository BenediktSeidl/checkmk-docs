:title: The {CMK} user interface
:description: Important components of the graphical user interface (GUI) of {CMK} are the navigation bar, main page and sidebar. These are the topics covered in this chapter of the {CMK} Beginner's guide, which guides you concisely through the first steps in setting up IT an monitoring with {CMK} in the most optimal way.

[#start_page]
== The start page

In the {CMK} user interface (_Graphical User Interface_, GUI) you will
see some elements that we do not need at this stage. Many of these are empty, or
show zeros, which is because we have not yet included any objects in the monitoring:

[{image-border}]
image::empty_dashboard.png[]

Nevertheless, you should familiarise yourself with the basic elements of the
interface. Most important is the division into the *navigation bar* on the
left, the *main page* in the middle, and the *side bar* on the right.


[#navigation_bar]
== The navigation bar

[{image-left}]
image::navbar.png[width=70]

With the _navigation bar_ on the left and the icons it
contains, you make the basic decisions about what {CMK} should do for you:

[.guihint]#Monitor# -- The monitoring itself

[.guihint]#Customize# -- For the customisation of interface elements useful for the monitoring (such as bookmarks, views, dashboards and graphs)


[.guihint]#Setup# -- for the setting up of the objects to be monitored (such as hosts and services)

Behind these three symbols are more or less extensive menus, the so-called
'mega menus' or symbol menus, whose entries are divided into several topics --
for example, in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu under the [.guihint]#Hosts# topic you will find entries
for configuring hosts, host groups, host tags and host-specific rules.
We will use one of these entries in the link:intro_setup_monitor.html[next chapter] when
setting up the first host.

At the bottom of the navigation bar, in the [.guihint]#User# menu, you will find entries
that apply to your {CMK} user account -- currently the user account for
`cmkadmin`. Here you can change the password, log out of the {CMK}
interface and personalise your profile. Interesting profile settings for the
interface include the choice of language, the display of icons in the navigation
bar (with or without titles), where icons are displayed in the 'mega menus'
(by topics or by entries), and whether {CMK} should rather
link:intro_gui.html#show_less_more[show less or show more].

In addition, in the [.guihint]#User# menu for important or frequently-used settings,
there is a quick access for switching, which saves you from having to open the
profile settings page. For example, by simply clicking on [.guihint]#Interface theme# you
can change the appearance of the interface -- from [.guihint]#Dark# to [.guihint]#Light# or vice versa.

In the [.guihint]#Help# menu you will find the edition and version of {CMK} currently in
use and some entries with which you can call up documentation and information -- inside
{CMK} or outside. Among other things, you can also open this User guide.

The navigation bar is completed at the very bottom by [.guihint]#Sidebar# (which allows
you to hide or show the sidebar by simply clicking on it) and at the very top by
the {CMK} logo. Clicking on the logo always takes you back to the default
dashboard displayed on the main page.


[#main_page]
== The main page

What you see on the main page depends on where you are in {CMK}.
After logging in, you will first see the standard or main link:intro_tools#dashboards[dashboard], which shows an
overview of the current status and recent events on the monitored objects:

image::mainpage_default.png[]

The content of the main page changes depending on your selection in the navigation
bar and also in the sidebar. For example, if you select to change your profile in
the [.guihint]#User# menu, all profile settings will be displayed on the main page.

Below the current page's title you can see the path to that page, always
starting with the name of the menu from the navigation bar. With the help of this
'breadcrumb navigation' you will always know where you are in {CMK}, even after
complex actions, i.e. currently on the [.guihint]#Main dashboard# page in Monitoring.


[#sidebar]
== The sidebar

The _sidebar_ is your {CMK} cockpit. It is the place where you have a
continuous overview of the most important monitoring information, as well as
quick access to the functions that you need most frequently in {CMK}.

image::sidebar_default.png[width=50%]

////
In the top row of the sidebar you will see a selection of 5 icons with important actions that many {CMK} users find particularly useful. Feel free to click through these icons in turn -- even if, due to the lack of monitored objects at this point, the information displayed is not yet more meaningful than on the [.guihint]#Main dashboard#, to which you can return by clicking on the first icon [.guihint]#Main#.
Below the 5 symbols begins the panel that you can arrange according to your own preferences.
////

You can compose the complete sidebar according to your preferences.
The sidebar elements, also called 'snapins', serve this purpose.
Snapins are compact GUI containers with predefined functions. Since the sidebar
is intended to hold *your* preferences, by default a new installation contains only a few snapins:

* [.guihint]#Overview# -- An overview of all monitored objects with their current status information
* [.guihint]#Bookmarks# -- Your personal bookmarks within {CMK}
* [.guihint]#Master Control# -- Various main switches for the monitoring

By the way, you can get more detailed information on the snapins just mentioned
in the link:intro_tools.html[chapter on monitoring tools].

If you click on icon:button_sidebar_add_snapin[] at the very bottom of the sidebar, the main page will show you all of the snapins that are currently
*not* in your sidebar and that you can add with a single click.
Try it out and fill the sidebar as a test.

Depending on the size of your screen, not all snapins may now be visible.
The fastest way to move vertically through the sidebar is to use the mouse wheel
while the mouse pointer is over the sidebar. On touchpads, this function is often
possible with the gesture 'slide two fingers up and down together' method.

In the sidebar you can manipulate the snapins like this:

* Expand or collapse: Click *in* the displayed title of the snapin. Alternatively, point to the title bar and then click icon:button_show_toolbar[] or icon:button_hide_toolbar[].
* Show more or less: Some snapins (like [.guihint]#Overview#) offer you two views -- either with only the most important information or with all information. Point the mouse at the title bar and click icon:button_showmore[] or icon:button_showless[] to switch between the two views.
* Move: Press the left mouse button *right next* to the title, drag the snapin up or down to another position in the sidebar and release the mouse button.
* Remove from sidebar: Point the mouse at the title bar and click icon:button_sidebar_close_snapin[].

So much for the options for customising the sidebar's content. As a whole, you
can hide and show the sidebar -- with [.guihint]#Sidebar# in the navigation bar -- and you
can move its position from right to left so that it docks with the navigation
bar -- in the menu [.guihint]#User > Sidebar position#.


[#show_less_more]
== Show less or Show more

{CMK} provides a wide range of setting and selection options in many places on
the interface. This selection can sometimes be quite overwhelming, so that one
can lose sight of the essentials and orientation becomes difficult -- not only,
but especially for newcomers to monitoring.

As a measure to reduce complexity, you will find three dots (*...*) in many
locations on the {CMK} interface, such as in the [.guihint]#Overview# or here on the far
right in the first line of the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu:

image::monitor_menu_showmore.png[]

Whenever you see these ellipsis points, {CMK} offers two views: In the 'Show less'
mode only the most important entries are shown (meant for the beginner),
and in the "Show more" mode all entries (for the expert). You can switch between
the two views by clicking on the omission points: show more with
icon:button_showmore[] and show less with icon:button_showless[].

You set the general behaviour in the settings for your user profile
([.guihint]#Users > Edit profile > Show more / Show less#) by setting one of the two modes
as the default -- or do without both modes and face the unfiltered complexity.


[#search]
== Searching and finding

In the {CMK} interface you will find two central locations for the search -- in
the monitoring environment in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, and in the configuration
environment in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu. The input fields for the search terms can be
found in the first line of the corresponding menu.


[#search_monitor]
=== Searching in the monitoring environment

In the link:intro_tools.html#monitor_menu[Monitor menu] you can search for hosts and
services. The search is very interactive, so as soon as you have typed something,
you will immediately see the results matching your input below the search field:

image::monitor_menu_search.png[width=65%]

Here are a few tips for searching:

* Upper and lower case is not relevant to the search.
* You can work freely with simple keywords.
* But you can also use filters to search for patterns within hostnames (with `h:`), patterns within service names (with `s:`) and you can combine the two. A search for `s:boot` will show you all services that contain `boot` and a search for `h:win s:cpu` will show you all services that contain `cpu` on any hosts that contain `win`.
* You do not have to select an entry from the suggestion list. After entering your search term, simply press the Enter key and you will receive the appropriate result on the main page in the form of a list of all hosts and/or services.
* You can save the search query in a link:intro_tools.html#bookmarks[bookmark].

The search function in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu is identical to that offered to you
by the [.guihint]#Quicksearch# snapin. Apart from the two filters `h:` and
`s:` mentioned above, there are others you can use. You can find out what
these are and how you can also use regular expressions in the
link:user_interface.html#quicksearch[article on the user interface].


[#search_setup]
=== Searching in the configuration environment

Using the search field in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, you can search the configuration
environment of {CMK}, i.e. the [.guihint]#Setup# menu itself, with all of its visible
entries and additionally with some hidden ones.

The _search scope_ includes, among other things, all rule sets that are
grouped into topics in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu and the _Global settings_.
Searches are carried out in the titles and the parameter names.

You search with free text, i.e. without filter rules as in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu.
You do not need to pay attention to upper and lower case. The search results are
displayed as you type:

image::setup_menu_search.png[]

The search for rule sets becomes interesting when it comes to
link:intro_finetune.html#rules[fine-tuning the monitoring] later on, but we are not there yet, because:
