= Installation of a virtual appliance

:title: Using Checkmk in the Appliance
:description: The official appliance makes setting up checkmk even easier. The installation is easy, with just a few clicks via a web interface.


== The virtual appliance

With the virtual appliance _Checkmk virt1_ you can run Checkmk as a guest on a
virtualization platform such as VMware.
VirtualBox is also supported and is particularly suitable for trying out
virtualization.

The operating system and Checkmk itself are already pre-installed in the
appliance. The appliance is ready for immediate use, is set up via a dialog,
and can be configured via its own web user interface.
You therefore do not need any Linux knowledge.
The appliance is delivered in the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) -- more
precisely in its OVA (Open Virtualization Archive) archive format.


== Download the appliance

Download the latest version of the OVA file in your
<a href="login.php?">customer portal</a>, if you have a valid
<a href="subscription.php?">subscription</a> with the virt1 option.
As an alternative, you can try out the virtual appliance of the (CFE) from
our <a href="download.php?">download portal</a> . Select _VMware ESXi / VirtualBox_
and then _Base Installation_.
The size of the OVA file is about 750 MB.


== Installation under VirtualBox

=== Prerequisites
For the following steps you need the OVA file, and an operational VirtualBox
installation. It does not matter on which system VirtualBox is running.

=== Import the appliance

Start the import of the OVA file via [.guihints]#File => Import Appliance.}}# 
You will immediately see all virtual machine settings -- and can leave these as
they are. Of course you can change the values at this point or later, for example,
to give the machine additional resources.

*Important:* Under the appliance settings, it is essential to select the
[.guihints]#Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters# option
in [.guihints]#Mac Address Policy# -- otherwise problems will occur if multiple
appliances with the same MAC address run on the network.

The appliance can now be imported.

After the import, you must perform another step: Call up the VM’s network
configuration. The mode is set to [.guihints]#Bridged Adapter# here -- the
virtual network adapter is connected to an adapter on your host -- and these of
of course vary. In case of doubt simply leave the configuration without any
changes with [.guihints]#OK# -- VirtualBox then automatically selects your default adapter
for the missing adapter.

This completes the VirtualBox-specific actions, and you can continue with the
[appliance_usage|basic configuration] of your appliance.


== Installation under ESXi

=== Prerequisites

Prerequisites for the following procedure: You already have an ESXi server in
the network with a data storage for the virtual machine’s
configuration.
You will also need the appliance’s OVA file.


=== Import the appliance

The import of the appliance runs largely automatically -- only afterwards you should
take another look at the network configuration.

. In the ESXi main navigation, select [.guihints]#Virtual Machines}}.# 
. Start the import assistant via [.guihints]#Create/Register VM}}.# 
. Select Import via OVA/OVF.
. Select the OVA file you downloaded before.
. Follow the assistant without doing any further changes.

The new machine will then be deployed, which may take a few minutes.

*Important: *The Checkmk virt1 is connected to a network interface of the
_E1000_ type -- an emulation of the 1 GB network adapter
_Intel 82545EM Gigabit Ethernet NIC_ -- for which the drivers are usually
already available. On an ESXi server, for better performance you should exchange
the card for a card of the _VMXNET 3_ type, i.e. for a
completely-virtualized 10 GB interface. To do this, install the VMWare tools and
change the setting under [.guihints]#virt1 => Edit => Network Adapter 1 => AdapterType.}}#

You will now have completed the VMWare-ESXi-specific steps and can use your
appliance’s [appliance_usage|basic configuration].
