MD:The official appliance makes setting up checkmk even easier. The installation is easy, with just a few clicks via a web interface.


== Installation of a virtual appliance
With the virtual appliance you can operate (CMK)
as a guest on an emulator such as VMware or HyperV. VirtualBox is also supported
and is particularly suitable for testing.

_(CMK) virt1_ comes completely preinstalled as OVA data with operating
system and is ready for use. It is set up using a dialog and can be configured
via its own web user interface. No knowledge of Linux is required.
The procedure is as follows:

=== Download the OVA file

From the <a href="download.php?HTML=yes">download page</a>
download the latest appropriate version of the OVA file. This will require a valid
<a href="subscription.php?">subscription</a> with the virt1 option.
Alternatively, for a trial the _demo version_ can be used (_(CMK) virt1 (demo)_).
This is free and contains a demo version of (CMK). The OVA file is approximately 750 MB.

=== Setting up the virtual machine

Follow one of the instructions below:

IN:cma_virt1_quick_start          Brief instructions for the Checkmk virt1
IN:cma_virt1_basic_virtualbox     Detailed instructions for using *VirtualBox*
IN:cma_virt1_basic_esx            Detailed instructions for using *VMWare ESXi*

=== Create a monitoring instance

If not already done, create a new Monitoring instance, e.g. with the name `mysite`.
Choose the latest available (CMK) version. This is achieved via the appliance's web interface.
Details may be found in [appliance_usage#site_management|article on monitoring instances] from the
appliance's handbook.

=== Login to the web interface for the instance.

The web interface can be reached at _http://HOSTNAME/mysite/_.
Use the credentials which you already defined with the creation of the instance.

Your (CMK) system is now ready for use. For a brief tutorial on how to configure
(CMK) and start monitoring, please read our
[check_mk_getting_started|Introduction to monitoring with (CMK) guide].

== Upgrading from (FE) to (SE)

When you decide at a later date to purchase a subscription for the (CSE),
you can convert your demo appliance to a full version without loss of data:

. Load a [appliance_usage#cma_webconf_firmware|current firmware] full version on to the appliance via the web interface.
. Install a full version of the (SE) or (ME) in the appliance's [appliance_usage#manage_cmk|version management].
. Change the desired instances to this version in the appliance's instance management.
