Hier here find some articles from outdated Checkmk versions.
We have added them into the manual because there are no new
articles for these topics yet -- but we are working hard on it.

*Please note: these articles had been written several years ago
and things in Checkmk might behave differently now.*

The majority of the legacy articles covers the development of own
check plugins. Plugins that you develop based on these articles
will probably work well, but use outdated APIs.
