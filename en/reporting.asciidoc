== Reports

In {CMK}, a report is a compilation of diverse elements -- link:views.html[views],
[availability|availability tables], link:graphing.html[graphs], text,
logos, etc., into a printable PDF document.

=== Characteristics of reports

* No external tool such as Jasper, DB, or similar is necessary.
* The PDF file is cleanly rendered with vector graphics.
* Reports can be managed using templates and by basing them on preformatted master copies.
* link:reporting.html#scheduler[The Report Scheduler] can send reports periodically as required.
* Instant reports can be produced using the [.guihint]#Export as PDF# button.

[CEE] The [.guihint]#Export as PDF# button is found in every view – when one of the
{EE} is being used.


== Report elements for the sidebar
A quick access of all reports, and link:reporting.html#scheduler[The Report Scheduler]
 is available via the report element in the side bar.

image::reportsnapin.png[center, width=280]

This element has three option buttons:


|===
|[.guihint]#Change Timerange#
|Changes the time range for instant reports.
|[.guihint]#Scheduler#
|Opens the Report Scheduler.
|[.guihint]#Edit#
|Opens a list of available reports.
|===



== Basic settings for reports


The basic settings for reports can be configured over
[.guihint]#WATO|Global Settings|Reporting#.

== Customising existing reports


As with [views|views] and link:dashboards.html[dashboards], {CMK}-supplied reports
cannot be changed – an existing report can be cloned, and the clone can
then be customised as desired.

Starting with the [.guihint]#Edit# button in the side bar, a list of all available
reports can be opened.

On the left side these symbols are ready to use for the editing:

=== Basic settings


Clicking on ICON[icon_new.png] opens a window for editing the basic
settings for the new report:

Enter the values for [.guihint]#Title}} and {{Topic#. If the report should be available for all
users, activate [.guihint]#Make this report available for all users#, and if the report
should not be available for selection in the side bar, select the
[.guihint]#Hide this report from the sidebar# option.

Switch to the [.guihint]#Report Properties# section. Here values for font, page format,
time and date settings, the report's layout and the file names for downloads
can be defined.

In the following [.guihint]#Context / Search Filters# section, search and filter values
can be specified.

Once all values have been defined as required, continue with one of the three buttons:
