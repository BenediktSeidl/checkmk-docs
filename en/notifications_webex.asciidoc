== Function

link:https://www.webex.com/team-collaboration.html[Webex Teams] is an
application for continuous team collaboration with Cisco video meetings,
group messaging and file sharing. Topics or teams are organized in so-called
Spaces. You can also use such a space to receive alerts from {CMK}.
For the actual connection a webhook must be created in Webex Teams.


== Configuring Cisco Webex Teams

The prerequisite for receiving alerts from {CMK} in Webex Teams is therefore
that at least one area (Space) is set up. This can be done in a few seconds and
is described in the Webex help:
link:https://help.webex.com/en-us/hk71r4/Webex-Teams-Create-a-Space[Webex Teams -- Create a Space].

For a first test, at any rate it is certainly a good idea to set up a dedicated
area with an appropriate name just for {CMK}.

In Webex Teams the _Incoming Webhooks_ app must now be activated or
connected. You can find this app in the
link:https://apphub.webex.com/teams/applications/incoming-webhooks-cisco-systems-38054[Webex App Hub].

Click on [.guihint]#Connect# on this page. (If you are not logged into Webex Teams with
the browser you are using, the Cisco Webex login screen will appear first).

After a short waiting period, at first it looks as if not much has changed -- but
now, at the end of the input and selection fields, you can specify both a name
for the webhook and the area to be used in Webex Teams. Finally click on [.guihint]#Add#.

Next, copy the Webhook URL created in this way by clicking on the corresponding
icon.

== Configuration in {CMK}

The activation in {CMK} is limited to the specification of the webhook URL
copied above:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# select [.guihint]#Cisco Webex Teams#.
. Enter (insert) the copied Web Hook URL.

Optionally, you may specify URL prefixes to control links on your {CMK} GUI
within the notification. Instead of specifying the webhook URL directly here,
you can also use WATO's password store and read the URL from one of its entries.

For testing you can use the [.guihint]#Fake check results#
and [.guihint]#Custom notification# link:commands.html[commands].
