_In this article, the screenshots and the GUI navigation described have not yet been updated to {CMK} version {v20}. However, *nothing fundamental has changed* in the described functions themselves and most of the functions can be found quickly with the [.guihint]#Monitor# or [.guihint]#Setup# menu search of the xref:user_interface#[{CMK} {v20} user interface]. We will update this article as soon as possible._
