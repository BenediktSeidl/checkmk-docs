== Function

The incident management platform link:https://www.splunk.com/en_us/observability/on-call.html[Splunk On-Call]
handles the distribution of messages from dozens of different sources,
which can be selected as integrations directly in the web interface.
A generic REST backend is available for {CMK}.


== Configuring Splunk On-Call

You do not need to explicitly activate the notifications from {CMK},
only the REST endpoint address:

. In Splunk On-Call under [.guihint]#Integrations#, call the [.guihint]#REST Generic# item.
. Copy the displayed REST endpoint URL.


== Configuration in {CMK}

In {CMK} you only need to specify this key:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# select the item [.guihint]#Splunk On-Call#.
. Enter (insert) the copied URL under [.guihint]#Splunk On-Call REST Endpoint#.

and [.guihint]#Custom notification# link:commands.html[commands].
