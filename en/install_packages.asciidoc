:description: Each distribution has its own special features which need to be considered during a software installation. These requirements are described in detail here.



==  Why Linux?

(CMK) is a comprehensive software package, which basically requires _Linux_
as its operating system. Why? Linux is an excellent platform for the operation
of Checkmk, because it is very performant and stable, and many important tools are
already integrated. Alongside this there is the pleasant side benefit of the
availability of completely-free distributions of Linux with Debian, Ubuntu and
CentOS, which are enterprise-capable and supported by Checkmk.

If you do not want to deal with Linux under any circumstances, it is also
possible to run Checkmk as [introduction_virt1|a virtual appliance], <a
href="appliance.php#physical_appliance">a physical appliance</a>, or as
[introduction_docker|a Docker-Container].


== Supported Distributions

Linux is a free system and offered by many producers in their own variants
(distributions).  This is of course very positive, because competition
stimulates business, increases quality, and as a user you always have the
possibility to switch to a Linux distribution that is better-suited to your
needs.

However, this diversity also has a disadvantage: The available distributions
differ in many details, among other things also in the versions of the provided
software libraries, directory paths, pre-configuration, etc.

To make sure that everything runs smoothly with Checkmk, we decided from the very
beginning to develop a separate installation package of Checkmk for every
important Linux distribution -- and even for every single version of these
distributions, as long as it is still being maintained by the developer. More
work for us -- less stress for you!

We currently support the following Linux distributions:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS from Version 6.0
* SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server (SLES) from Version 12 SP1
* Debian from Version 8.0
* Ubuntu from Version 14.04

For Checkmk the installation you need a physical or virtual server on which you
have already installed Linux. The installation is then achieved in four steps:

. Preparing the Linux-System
. Setting-up the package sources
. Downloading of the appropriate Checkmk package
. Installation of the Checkmk package


== Preparation of the Linux system

Depending on which distribution you are installing, different steps are
necessary for the preparation. For this reason we will assume that the Linux
system on which the Checkmk is to be installed has been installed with the
developer’s default settings, and correctly-connected to the network, so that it
is accessible via HTTP and SSH from your workplace.


=== Partitioning hard drive space

(CMK) stores its data under the `/opt/omd` physical path. If the system
is to be used exclusively for Checkmk, the major part of the hard drive’s free
space should be available. In this case it is not essential -- but very
desirable -- that `/opt/omd`, or `/opt` has its own partition.


[#smtpconfig]
=== SMTP for outgoing emails

If you wish to send monitoring notifications by email, then for outgoing emails
a correct configuration of the SMTP service is required. Usually you define a
smarthost to which all emails are to be redirected.


=== Settings for the system time

In order for the monitoring server to have a correct system time, we strongly
recommend setting up NTP. The hardware clock should be set to UTC. As soon as
the server is taken into monitoring with Checkmk, NTP will ensure the correct time
is used for all functions.


== Installation instructions

Depending on the Linux distribution you want to install Checkmk onto, please
follow one of the dedicated installation instruction below:

* [install_packages_debian|Debian und Ubuntu]
* [install_packages_redhat|Red Hat Enterprise Linux und CentOS]
* [install_packages_sles|SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]
