:title: Quick start guide for Checkmk virt1
:description: Short set-up guide for the virtual Checkmk appliance.


* Download the required {CMK} virt1 archive from our link:https://checkmk.com/appliance-download.php[website].
* Import the archive (file extension `.ova`) into your hypervisor.
* Launch the imported virtual machine and open the local console.
* During the launching procedure, a dialogue box asking you to initialise the data medium will appear on the screen. Confirm this box. After a few minutes the launching procedure will resume.
* On completion of the launching procedure, the console status screen will be displayed.
* So that the appliance can be used for monitoring, there are some settings that need to be made. Press the key `&lt;F1&gt;` and, using the configuration dialogue box, configure the following settings as a minimum:
* Network configuration
* Access to the web interface
* Once you have configured these settings, you can access the web interface from a computer connected to the network by entering the URL `http://&lt;ipaddress&gt;/` into the web browser. Log into the web interface using the password you just configured.
* In order to make things such as name resolution and sending emails possible, you must make further settings in the web interface. You can read more about this in the article on link:appliance_usage.html[basic configuration on the web interface]. You do not need this to get started however.
* Select the item link:appliance_usage.html#site_management[instance administration] on the menu now shown and click on _Create new instance_ on the following page.
* Now create a new monitoring instance using the current dialogue box. This instance will start automatically.
* You can now call up the URL `http://&lt;ipaddress&gt;/&lt;instanz-id&gt;/` in your browser.
* Log in using the access data you selected when creating the instance.
