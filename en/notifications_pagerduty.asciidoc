== Function


The link:https://www.pagerduty.com[PagerDuty] incident management
platform can receive messages from a wide variety of sources and process them
further -- for example by filtering, sending notifications or initiating
escalations.
Notifications from {CMK} can be easily forwarded to the platform via a so-called integration key.


== Configuring PagerDuty

PagerDuty provides integrations for many popular tools, including {CMK}. All you
need is an _Integration Key,_ which you create under PagerDuty as follows:

. Create a new service or open an existing one.
. In the corresponding service create a new integration via the [.guihint]#Integrations# tab.
. Assign any name and for the [.guihint]#Integration Type# choose [.guihint]#Check_MK.#
. Copy the created [.guihint]#Integration Key.#


== Configuration in {CMK}

In {CMK} the integration requires only the specification of the integration key:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose the item [.guihint]#PagerDuty.#
. Enter the copied key under [.guihint]#Integration Key#.

The filtering of the generated notifications can be implemented either in {CMK},
or in PagerDuty via the [.guihint]#Event Rules#. You can also optionally switch the
PagerDuty connection to your own {CMK} user account. Simply create a standard
user with a disabled login, and then create a personal notification rule.

You can test the connection using the link:commands.html[commands]. Use the
[.guihint]#Fake check results# command and set a host covered by the rule to {DOWN}.
