= NagVis: status data on maps and diagrams
:revdate: 2018-06-26
:title: Creating maps in Checkmk with NagVis
:description: The NagVis open source tool is an integral part of checkmk. This article provides an ideal introduction to the tool and its integration into checkmk.


== What is NagVis?

In the article on [monitoring_basics#parents|Monitoring basics]
you saw the map of a network's topology based on
[monitoring_basics#parents|Parent-Child-Relationships].  NagVis is responsible
for such maps. The Nagios-Extension enables a visualisation of, for example,
infrastructures, servers, ports or processes.

NagVis' mode of operation is basically very simple: Checkmk, or to be more
precise [livestatus|Livestatus], provides backend data such as hosts, services,
host groups and service groups.  These elements from your monitoring can
be placed as icons on various maps.  These dynamic icons can then show the
current status of each of the hosts and services.  More detailed additional
information can be provided by hover-menus.  And finally, the icons and other
elements are also links to the Checkmk-objects that they represent. Other
available elements are lines, performance displays (Gadgets) and containers
for external contents.

To get a better conception of what can be achieved with NagVis in Checkmk,
here are three examples:

* Geographic maps based on Open Street Map for managing sites
* Automatic topological maps from Parent-Child-Relationships
* Maps of individual switches or server rooms to enable an overview of ports and hardware

Provided the [monitoring_basics#parents|Parent-Child-Relationships] have
been defined, without further action you can call up a map from the basic
articles using [.guihints]#Views => Overview => Network Topology# in the navigation.
Aditional steps are unnecessary here.

== Setting-up NagVis

NagVis is fully-integrated in Checkmk and configured so that you can
immediately begin adding elements from your monitoring to maps.

To start NagVis, first open the section with available Sidebar-Snapins
using the ICON[button_sidebar_addsnapin_lo.png] button at the lower left of
the navigation.  Here select the [.guihints]#NagVis Maps# snapin, and finally start
NagVis with the ICON[button_view_snapin_edit.png] button.

image::bilder/sidebar_add_snapin2.png[align=center,width=280]

Before you create your first map you should have a look at the basic
configuration in [.guihints]#Options => General Configuration}}.#  Here can be found
over 100 options for the basics, such as data formats and language
settings, from the displaying of objects on maps, to the weighting of
the available host and service statuses. All options are explained in the
<ahref="http://docs.nagvis.org/1.8/en_US/index.html">NagVis-Documentation</a>.

At this point we would like to do without a comprehensive description for the
use of NavGis, and especially its configuration options.  NagVis itself has
a very good, detailed <ahref="https://www.nagvis.org/doc">Documentation.</a>
In the following section we will restrict ourselves to the most essential
basics for generating simple, useful maps using NagVis in Checkmk.

== Creating maps

=== The various types of maps

NagVis provides a total of five different map types: regular, dynamic,
automatic and interactive/non-interactive geographic maps.

[.guihints]#Regular Map# is the standard type of map. The maps can visualise any desired
scenario – from switch ports, to server rooms, to complete infrastructures.
The elements (Icons, Lines, etc.) are added individually to the maps from
the inventories of the Checkmk hosts and services.

[.guihints]#Dynamic Maps# largely resemble the Regular Maps, with a significant
difference however: hosts, services, Host and service groups are
not explicitly specifed, but instead by using filters in the form of
[regexes|Regular expressions]; to put it more accurately, in the form of
valid [livestatus|Livestatus-Filter-Definitions.]  In this way new hosts
and services, and likewise any alterations land automatically on the map
without additional manual action being required.

[.guihints]#Automaps based on parent/child relations# you have already met.  These are
the network topology maps mentioned at the start of this article which are
generated fully-automatically from the Parent-Child-Relationships defined
in Checkmk.

[.guihints]#Geographical Maps# are maps rendered with map material from the
Open-Street-Map(OSM)-Projekt for their backgrounds.


=== Generating an automatic map

The quickest facility for generating a representative map is the
Parent-Child-Automap.  Create a new map of the [.guihints]#Automap based on parent/child relations}}# 
type via [.guihints]#Options => Manage Maps => CreateMap}}.#  In [.guihints]#ID# enter
the internal name [.guihints]#myautomap}},# and in [.guihints]#Alias# your name for the display
[.guihints]#My Automap}}.# 

image::bilder/nagvis2_automap_create.png[]

The map itself will immediately appear in the Content Area, and its
corresponding link will appear in the NagVis-Sidebar-Snapin. Automap-specific
settings can next be customised in [.guihints]#Edit Map => MapOptions => Automap}}.# 
The point [.guihints]#render_mode# is particularly interesting as it provides the
fundamental layout of the nodes on the map.

image::bilder/nagvis2_automap_options.png[]

In addition the roots of the map can be specified here – although that is
simpler to achieve with a right-mouseclick on an icon on the map, and then
making an entry in the [.guihints]#Make root# context-menu.

image::bilder/nagvis2_automap_contextmenu.png[]


=== Creating a regular map

[.guihints]#Regular Maps# are the commonest maps in NagVis.  So that you can to get
to know NavGis' procedures and its most important elements, we will show
you how to create a small map of a server-rack.  This will visualise a host
on an individual background, and provide optical and acoustic warnings when
the monitored host is not (OK).

To create the map open the options via [.guihints]#Options => Manage Maps}}.#  Here in
[.guihints]#Create Map# give the map the name [.guihints]#mymap# and the alias [.guihints]#My Map}}.# For
the [.guihints]#Map Type# select [.guihints]#Regular map# and verify it with [.guihints]#Create# button.

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_create.png[]

Next import a photo of the rack being monitored as the background – this
is achieved using [.guihints]#Options => Manage Backgrounds}}.# Simply select the local
file and verify it with the [.guihints]#Upload# button.

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_upload-background.png[]

Now the imported image must be defined as the background for the current
map.  Call up the map options with [.guihints]#Edit Map => MapOptions# and go to the
[.guihints]#Appearance# tab. Here activate the [.guihints]#map_image# option and select the
desired image from the dropdown-menu. Don't save that right now – a setting
from the maps options is still needed.

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_background.png[]

Go to the [.guihints]#Obj. Defaults# tab. Here you can activate the [.guihints]#label_show}}# 
option.  This option enables the host and service icons on the map to be
labelled with their appropriate host/service names – otherwise the icons
will only be identified via their hover-menus. Finally, save these settings.

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_show-label.png[]

Now it is time to add the host. Click on [.guihints]#Edit Map => AddIcon => host# and then
with the curser (which now appears as a cross) at the position on the map where
the icon is to be placed – at this point the [.guihints]#Create Object}}-dialogue# 
will open.  In the [.guihints]#General# tab simply select the desired host from the
dropdown-menu in [.guihints]#host_name# and save. If you operate multiple Checkmk
sites, an alternative data source can be used via [.guihints]#backend_id}}.# 

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_host_create.png[]

The icon is now positioned on the map, and it provides detailed information
via a hover-menu. Clicking on the icon takes you directly to the host in
(CMK) – all of the objects positioned in NagVis are now links to your
(CMK) objects.

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_host-hover.png[]

The edit mode needs to be activated to be able to move or edit an icon.
Right-click on the icon to open its context menu, and select [.guihints]#Unlock}}.# 

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_icon-menu_locked.png[]

Now you can move the icon, or again open the context menu: Here a number of
new options will be seen which will enable the object to be cloned, deleted
or edited, or to acknowledge a problem directly from here by choosing the
[.guihints]#Acknowledge# option. See [basics_ackn|acknowledge.] 

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_icon-menu_unlocked.png[]

Once the editing of a host/icon is complete, again open its context menu and
select [.guihints]#Lock}}.#  By the way, with [.guihints]#Edit Map => Lock/Unlockall# the editing
mode can also be activated and deactivated for the complete map.

You can now add further hosts to the map.  Adding services, host and service
groups functions in a similar way.  To round things off, the map can be
so configured that when loading, problems will be signalled by a warning
alarm and blinking host icons.  For this, call up [.guihints]#Edit Map => MapOptions}}# 
and switch to the [.guihints]#Events# tab.  Here, at the top of the display, activate
the alarms with [.guihints]#event_on_load}},# and at the bottom check the [.guihints]#event_sound}}# 
box to receive audible warnings.

image::bilder/nagvis2_regularmap_events.png[]


=== Creating a geographical map

Geographical maps are available in two different forms: The _interactive_
variant can be scrolled and zoomed in the way we know from Google Maps & Co.,
and its background is set automatically. Objects that have been placed on such
maps will appear on every subsequent map of the same type.  NagVis assumes
that an object will always be found at a specific location regardless of the
scale of the the map. So for example, a host located in Hamburg will appear on
a world map as well as on a map of Germany and of course on a map of Hamburg.

NagVis ultimately views the various map sections and zoom-levels only
as _Viewports_.  At any time viewports can be saved as a separate,
new map. Since viewports/maps can likewise be diplayed as icons on maps, to
some extent maps can be nested.  So for example, a map of Germany with its
dependencies can be called-up, and then with a click a more detailed view
of a state, and then as needed maps for a specific subsidiary, server room,
and from there even to a map for an individual switch.

In contrast to manual navigation, using an interactive map is quicker and
more convenient, and as well the individual maps are active so that for
example, they can be displayed in parallel on separate monitors, or set for
automatic rotation on a single monitor (more on this later). Also important:
in this way a summary of the related maps is thus available as a hover-menu.
This also makes using them more intuitive for third parties since they don't
have to click through hierarchies, or need to know where zooming is necessary.

The _non-interactive_ geographical maps must be fed with a CSV-file
containing the hosts and coordinates to be rendered.  There are no general
pre-existing elements in this case.

In the documentation the _interactive_ geographical maps are called
[.guihints]#Worldmaps}},# and the _non-interactive_ variants are called [.guihints]#Geomaps}}.# 
Worldmaps were first added to the current 1.9 version of NagVis, and until
now only explained in the English documentation.

Example: create an interactive map for all of Germany, and to this link a new
viewport for Nordrhein-Westfalen. Create an interactive geographical map –
a [.guihints]#Worldmap# – with [.guihints]#Options => Manage Maps => CreateMap}}.# As [.guihints]#Map Type}}# 
select the [.guihints]#Geographical Map (interactive)# option – the ID [.guihints]#(mygeomap)}}# 
and Alias [.guihints]#(My Geographical Map)# can also be defined here.

image::bilder/nagvis2_geomap_create.png[]

To finish, specify the map section which is desired as the overview, and
save this view using [.guihints]#Edit Map => Viewport => Saveview}}.# 

image::bilder/nagvis2_geomap_save-view.png[]

Next zoom into the map until the desired detail for NRW is reached. This
time save the view with [.guihints]#Map => Viewport => Save as new map# as the new map
[.guihints]#mygeomap_nrw}}.# 

image::bilder/nagvis2_geomap_save-viewport.png[]

The map's alias will be adopted from the original map so that links in the
navigation will now have two map names [.guihints]#My Geographical Map}}.#  Therefore now
define a new alias [.guihints]#NRW# with [.guihints]#Edit Map => MapOptions}}.# 

image::bilder/nagvis2_geomap_vieport-alias.png[]

Switch to the map of Germany [.guihints]#My Geographical Map# and add the link to
the NRW-map with [.guihints]#Edit Map => AddIcon => Map}}.# In the subsequent
[.guihints]#Create Object}}-dialogue# you only need to specify the [.guihints]#mygeomap_nrw# map from
the selection menu.

image::bilder/nagvis2_geomap_map-icon_create.png[]

Afterwards a click on the new icon in the map of Germany takes you directly
to the NRW map.  In the same way additional maps can be linked together,
and of course a navigation from the NRW map back to the map of Germany can
also be built-in.

image::bilder/nagvis2_geomap_map-link.png[]

The actual loading of the map contents also corresponds with the procedure
for the other map types. But remember – all objects added to ANY of the
'Worldmaps' will also appear on EVERY other 'Worldmap' since they are really
only alternative views of the real geographic situation.


=== Creating a dynamic map

Dynamic maps differ from the [.guihints]#Regular Maps# – as mentioned earlier –
in the method of adding their elements. Instead of manual additions the
[.guihints]#Dynamic Maps# receive their elements – hosts, services, and likewise
host and service groups – dynamically via Livestatus filters.

As an example, a map should automatically receive the [.guihints]#CPU load}}-services# 
from all hosts.

To create such a map, again begin with [.guihints]#Options => Manage Maps => CreateMap}},# 
and allocate an ID [.guihints]#(mydynamicmap)# and alias [.guihints]#(My Dynamic Map)}}.# 

image::bilder/nagvis2_dynmap_create.png[]

Next open the map options with [.guihints]#Edit Map => MapOptions# and select the
[.guihints]#Dynmap# tab.  Here activate the [.guihints]#dynmap_object_types# option and choose
the services as the object type.

The interesting part now follows with the second option
[.guihints]#dynmab_object_filter}},# with which the filter for the services is defined.
Use the simple [livestatus|Livestatus-Abfrage] [.guihints]#Filter: description ~ CPU load\n}}.# 
With this the string [.guihints]#CPU load# will be searched for in the
[.guihints]#description# column.  This _\n_ doesn't belong to the filter itself,
rather it generates a line-break required by the Livestatus query contructed
by the filter.

image::bilder/nagvis2_dynmap_options_filter.png[]

If you now save, all of your monitoring's [.guihints]#CPU load}}-services# will land on
the map.  As well, any new objects in the monitoring which match the filter
will be added automatically to the map.

image::bilder/nagvis2_dynmap_auto-icons.png[]

In the NagVis documentation it is also described how the configuration
functions directly by using the Config file.

*By the way:* since dynamic maps can also be saved as static maps with
[.guihints]#Actions => Export to static map}},# this method can be used as a beginner's
help to create static maps containing very many elements.


== Customising maps

=== Lines

NagVis provides various types of lines: there are purely decorative lines
without further functions under [.guihints]#Edit Map => AddSpecial => StatelessLine}},# 
lines which visualise hosts and services with 'traffic light colours' in the
same way as for icons, and the [.guihints]#Weathermap Lines}}.# These last visualise
network bandwidths using seven distinct colours. To create lines with this
'weather map style' preceed as follows:

Start with [.guihints]#Edit Map => AddLine => service# and select a host and a network
interface in the [.guihints]#Create Object# dialogue.

image::bilder/nagvis2_lines_create.png[]

Next, switch to the [.guihints]#Appearance# tab and set the [.guihints]#view_type# to [.guihints]#line}}.# 
As the [.guihints]#line_type# activate the [.guihints]#--%+BW-><-%+BW--# variant – with this
lines will be generated for upload and download and they will include labels
for percentage (%) and absolute (BW) bandwidth.

image::bilder/nagvis2_lines_line-type.png[]

Once saved the lines will appear on the map. Clicking on the 'lock' symbol
in the middle allows the end points as well as the middle point of the line
to be moved.

image::bilder/nagvis2_lines_weatherlines.png[]

NagVis also provides a default legend: using [.guihints]#Edit Map => AddSpecial => shape}}# 
insert a so-called _Form_ – simply an image in NagVis. In the [.guihints]#icon}}# 
option simply choose the image _demo_traffic_load_legend.png_ from
the dropdown-menu.

image::bilder/nagvis2_lines_weatherlines_result.png[]


=== Gadgets

Gadgets, like lines and icons are aids to visualisation on a map.  They show
performance data in the form of speedometers, thermometers or similar.
Consequently these are only available for services. As an example, the load
on a network interface can be created in the style of a speedometer:

Next, add a service as an icon to your map using [.guihints]#Edit Map => AddIcon => service}}.# 
In the [.guihints]#General# tab choose [.guihints]#myhost# as the host, and a suitable network
interface as the service.

Switch to the [.guihints]#Appearance# tab and set [.guihints]#view_type# to [.guihints]#gadget}}.#  Directly
below, activate [.guihints]#gadget_url}}.# Here there are a number of display variations
which correspond to the data in _share/nagvis/htdocs/userfiles/gadgets/_.
Select [.guihints]#std_speedometer.php# for the speedometer display.

image::bilder/nagvis2_gadget_speedometer.png[]


=== Container/iFrames

An interesting possibility for showing external information is provided by
[.guihints]#Container}}.#  Here you can simply specify a URL and allow the target to
be displayed in an an iFrame.  As an example, a host group view restricted
purely to the table should serve as an [views#embed_views|embedded view].

Add a container to your map using [.guihints]#Edit Map => AddSpecial => Container}}.# 
In contrast to host and service icons, here you can't simply click on the map,
rather you must draw a frame. This can of course be modified at any later time.
A dialogue will options will again open.

In the [.guihints]#General# tab set the [.guihints]#view_type# to [.guihints]#iframe}}.# 
The actual work is in the [.guihints]#url# option: The basis-URL can be
gotten with ICON[button_frameurl.png] on the Host Group View page.
Subsequently the [views#embed_views|Embed a view] options are
missing with which only the table is actually displayed (plus a
bit of background).  Thus the URL can look something like this:
`/mysite/check_mk/view.py?view_name=hostgroups&display_options=tbdezocf`.

image::bilder/nagvis2_container.png[]


=== Making maps rotate

On NagVis' overview page you may have noticed the point [.guihints]#Rotations# at the
lower left, or respectively in the middle of the list of maps in [.guihints]#Rotation Pools}}.# 
Maps can be set to rotate automatically at any desired interval,
which for example is practical for publicly-visible information monitors.
The configuration is performed in the NagVis configurations File. Open
the [.guihints]#/omd/mysite/etc/nagvis/nagvis.ini.php# file, and scroll to line 440
where the [.guihints]#Rotation pool definitions# can be found. Here three lines are
required to define a Rotations-Pool, the appropriate maps, and the interval.
In the below example the pool [.guihints]#myrotation# has been configured with the
maps [.guihints]#mymap1}},# [.guihints]#mymap3# and [.guihints]#mymap}},# and with an interval of 30 seconds:

.etc/nagvis/nagvis.ini.php

----[rotation_myrotation]
maps="mymap1,mymap2,mymap3"
interval=30
----
