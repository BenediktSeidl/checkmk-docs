== Introduction

With commands influencing hosts, services and other objects,
you can intervene in the monitoring process.
The commands are most often used for [basics_ackn|acknowledging problems], and for setting
[basics_downtimes|scheduled downtime]. There are numerous further commands
however, some of which are reserved for the administrator. Which commands
are available in a view depends on your access rights ([wato_user|Role]),
as well as on the type of object being displayed. Commands are accessed
via the small hammer icon ICON[commands.png] on a view’s title. This opens
several entry fields such as those for acknowledging problems, for example:

Each button shown represents a type of command. Some require further
information, such as e.g., a text for the acknowledgement. Please don’t forget
the online help ICON[icon_help.png] if you need information regarding a
command. Clicking the button opens the confirmation panel:

Important: if you confirm with [.guihints]#Yes# here, the chosen command will be
carried out on *all* objects shown in the current window! If you first
wish to make a selection there are three possibilities:

* Go into the host’s or service’s detail display so that the command only takes effect there.
* Set further filters by clicking on ICON[filter.png] in order to reduce the list of displayed objects.
* Activate the *checkboxes* ICON[checkboxes.png].

Activated checkboxes open an extra column on the view’s left side where objects
can be selected which the command will act on. A click on the small *x*
at the top of the column will switch all of a table’s checkboxes on or off.

== Further commands
In the [.guihints]#Downtimes# panel you will find tools to manually enter maintenance times for
the desired hosts and services. For a detailed explanation see the article
[basics_downtimes|Scheduled downtimes].

The next tool [.guihints]#Fake Check Results# allows you to manually-determine the results of
any check, i.e., the output of a plug in, performance data or simply the status of a
host or service. This is useful, for example, to test the effects of different outputs
and statuses on monitoring, views or [notifications#notification_testing|Notifications].

Finally, the section [.guihints]#Various Commands# offers all kinds of different tools -- for
example, for activating/deactivating notifications and checks in order to temporarily
exclude certain areas of the infrastructure from monitoring. The options are essentially
self-explanatory, but the [.guihints]#Reschedule active checks# item deserves a special mention.
You can use this to manually trigger active checks, such as the
[.guihints]#Hardware/Software Inventory}},# outside its usual cycle. However, for many hosts this
could cause short-term peaks in CPU usage. To counteract this the checks can be evenly
distributed over a period of minutes.
