MD:This article describes how to run a complete monitoring of Docker nodes and their containers in (CMK) and what you need to be aware of.

== Introduction

image::bilder/docker_logo_breit.png[align=float,left]

In recent years the container concept has taken the IT world by storm.
That has of course thrown up questions about the monitoring of such containers.
From Version VERSION[1.5.0] (CMK) can monitor Docker containers directly
via the [agent_linux|Linux agent]. But (CMK) monitors not only the
general status of the daemon or the containers,  but also the containers itself.
A full list of the elements that can currently be monitored can
be found in [check_plugins_catalog|Catalogue of the Check plug-ins].

Alongside the status and inventory information which (CMK) can determine over the
node (docker-jargon for '{{the host on which the containers are running}}'),# (CMK)
can also determine detailed status information for the containers.
For this every container has to be added as a seperate host in (CMK) if
the container is to be monitored. Its data will be piggybacked from the node to this host.

From VERSION[1.6.0] of the (CEE), container hosts can be automatically
created or removed using the [dcd|dynamic configuration].

== Set-up

=== Installation of agent and plug-ins

To be able to monitor a Docker node with (CMK),
it must first be monitored with the normal [agent_linux#Installation|Linux Agents].
This will as usual give you a basic monitoring of the host system,
however there will be no information about the Docker daemon or about the container.

You will need the following [agent_linux#plugins|Agent-Plug-ins]:

* In version VERSION[1.5.0] the two plug-ins `mk_docker_node` and `mk_docker_container_piggybacked`
* From version VERSION[1.6.0] only the `mk_docker.py` plug-in is needed

Install the plug-in or plug-ins as usual to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins`.
In the (CEE) you can of course also do this with the [wato_monitoringagents#bakery|Agent Bakery],
which comes with appropriate rule sets for monitoring Docker:

* In version VERSION[1.5.0] the [.guihints]#Docker node# and [.guihints]#Piggybacked Docker containers# rule sets
* From version VERSION[1.6.0] the [.guihints]#Docker node and containers# rule set

Please note, starting with VERSION[1.6.0] the `docker` Python library is required
(not `docker-py`). At least version 2.0.0 is necessary (you can easily check this by entering `python` on the command line):

[source,bash]
----
RP:python
Python 2.7.16 (default, Sep 24 2019, 22:49:21)
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux2
Type ‘help’, ‘copyright’, ‘credits’ or ‘license’ for more information.
>>> *import docker*
>>> *docker.version*
'4.0.2'
----

If required you can install the library with `pip`:
[source,bash]
----
RP:pip install docker
----

*Attention:* The packages, `docker-py` or `python-docker-py` respectively, must not be installed.
These make an outdated and incompatible version of the Docker library available under the same namespace!
If `docker-py` (or both variants) have been installed,
a single uninstall is not enough because `pip` cannot fix the namespace.
To ensure that the correct version is installed, please execute the following commands in this case:

[source,bash]
----
RP:pip uninstall docker-py docker
RP:pip install docker
----

If you now perform service discovery in WATO and activate the changes,
you should find some new services that affect the Docker node itself (here from version VERSION[1.6.0]):

=== Finetuning the plug-in

As of VERSION[1.6.0] you can configure different parameters of the plug-in.
For example you can save resources by deactivating unnecessary sections or, if required,
by customizing the Docker API Engine endpoint (the default is the Unix socket `unix://var/run/docker.sock`).

As usual, create the configuration file `/etc/check_mk/docker.cfg`. A template with detailed
explanations can be found in the Checkmk directory `share/check_mk/agents/cfg_examples/docker.cfg`.

In the (EE) you can easily configure all parameters with the [wato_monitoringagents#bakery|Agent Bakery].



=== Monitoring the container

==== Creating the container hosts

Of course the interesting aspect is the monitoring of the Docker containers.
This happens automaticall by installing the plug-ins. However the services will not be assigned to the docker node,
rather (CMK) assumes a single host per docker container.

The mechanism used here is called [piggyback|piggyback]:
The plug-in or special agent transports data of other hosts ‘piggybacked’ so to speak
along. (CMK) places this data in the `tmp/check_mk/piggyback` directory.
All you have to do in WATO is to create hosts with the correct names, and the services will then be automatically assigned to them.

From version VERSION[1.6.0] of the (EE) you can have these hosts created automatically.
Use the [.guihints]#Piggyback# connector in the [dcd|dynamic configuration].
Please note the following, if you create the hosts manually:

* The host name must exactly match the directory created in `tmp/check_mk/piggyback`. By default, this is the 12-digit short ID of the container (for example, `2ed23056480f`)
* If the containers do not have their own IP addresses (which is usually the case), set [.guihints]#IP-Address-Family# to [.guihints]#No IP}}.# 
* For [.guihints]#Data sources# be sure to set [.guihints]#Check_MK Agent# to [.guihints]#No agent}}.# 
* You can set the [.guihints]#Parent# field to the host name of the Docker node.
* It is also important that the Docker node and its container are monitored from the same (CMK) instance.

Once the container hosts have been created, and after performing a service discovery,
new services appear on these.

If you have a [agent_linux#Installation|Linux Agent] installed in the container,
it will be executed automatically. However since many services monitored by the agent within the
containers actually show information from the node (for example, CPU load, temperature
and many other operating system parameters), these were removed with version VERSION[1.6.0].


==== Alternative names for container hosts

By default – as mentioned above – the 12-digit short ID for the container is used as the name for the container host.
This can optionally be configured differently. To do this, in the configuration file
set the `container_id` option to `long` in order to use the complete container ID as the name,
or to `name` in order to use the container name.
(CEE) users can of course do this in the [wato_monitoringagents#bakery|Agent Bakery]

Additionally with the rule set [.guihints]#Access to agents => Generalsettings => Hostnametranslation for piggybacked hosts}}# 
you can define fairly flexible rules with which hostnames – which are
contained in the piggyback data – are converted to generate better host names for (CMK).
With this method you can also solve the problem of having containers with the same name on two
different Docker nodes, for example.
Using appropriate translation rules you could then, e.g., add a prefix to the names to make them explicit.

==== Monitoring the host's status

Since a container's [monitoring_basics#hosts|host status] cannot really be
verified using [cmc_differences#smartping|TCP-Packets or ICMP],
this must be determined in another way.
The [.guihints]#Docker container status# service facilitates this – in any case it checks
whether or not the container is running, and can thus be used as a secure tool
for detecting the host's status. Define a rule in the [.guihints]#Host Check Command# rule set
for this purpose, and set the [.guihints]#Use the status of the service# option to the
mentioned service.
Don't forget to set the conditions so that only containers are affected.
In our example all containers are located in a folder with the same name:

image::bilder/docker_container_hoststatus.png[align=center]

==== Operating the agent directly in the container

To monitor details in the container itself (e.g., running processes, databases, log files, etc.),
it is necessary that the (CMK) agent in the container itself is executed.
This is especially true for the roll out of agent plug-ins.
If you do not have an agent installed in the container, up to version VERSION[1.5.0] of (CMK) an agent will be
automatically executed in the container by the agent installed on the node as soon as you monitor the node with (CMK).

Since this method has proven to be not very performant, from version VERSION[1.6.0] it is necessary to
use the normal (CMK) agent installed directly in the container to get a more detailed monitoring of the container.
The three plug-ins, `mem`, `cpu` and `diskstat` (Disk I/O) work without an
agent in the container and are calculated by the (CMK) agent on the node itself.

Especially for self-created Docker images you might want to roll out the agent itself into the container.
In this case the data is no longer calculated – as described above – by the agent of the Docker node.
Instead of this a separate agent runs in each container.
Calling this agent will still be bundled in a piggyback procedure via the Docker node however.

However the agent installed in the container only works if all necessary commands are also present in the container.
Especially with minimally-built containers based on Alpine Linux it could very well be that elemental things such as bash are not present.
In such a situation you should monitor the container from the Docker node.

The use of the [.guihints]#Host Check Command# rule set will in this case only be required if
the container is not pingable – but it will otherwise function exactly as described above.

== Diagnostic options

=== Diagnosis of a Docker node

Should the setup not be successful, there are a number of options for analysing the problem.
The (CMK)-Agent supports Docker monitoring from Version VERSION[1.5.0].
Verify therefore that an agent with at least this or a later version is installed on the host.

If the version of the agent on the host is high enough, next check if the data is
present in the output. The output can be downloaded as text data using the
[.guihints]#Download agent output# option of the Host Dropdown menu in the GUI:

image::bilder/docker_node_dropdown.png[align=center,width=55%]

Alternatively, you could search the Agent-Cache directly. For clarity the output
in the following example is abreviated to the output for the node:

[source,bash]
----
OM:strings tmp/check_mk/cache/mydockerhost | grep "&lt&lt&ltdocker"
<<<docker_node_info>>>
<<<docker_node_disk_usage:sep(44)>>>
<<<docker_node_images>>>
<<<docker_node_network:sep(0)>>>
----


If the sections are not shown here, the Docker installation will not be recognised.
In version VERSION[1.5.0] the following command is used for the [.guihints]#Docker node info# service.
This command must be executable in exactly this form on the host system.
If necessary, check your Docker installation:

[source,bash]
----
RP:docker info 2>&1
----

=== Diagnosis for a container host

If the container host receives no data, or respectively, no services are detected,
first check if piggyback data is available for this host.
The host's name must be identical to the ID of the container.
Alternatively, using the [.guihints]#hostname translation for piggybacked hosts# rule set
you can also perform a mapping manually.
Here, however, only the [.guihints]#Explicit hostname mapping# option is available:

image::bilder/docker_container_namemapping.png[align=center,width=70%]

To verify whether piggyback data will be created for an ID, you can
check the following directory:

[source,bash]
----
OM:ls -l tmp/check_mk/piggyback/
76adfc5a7794  f0bced2c8c96  bf9b3b853834
----


== Host labels

From version VERSION[1.6.0] of (CMK) there are so-called [labels|host labels].
The redesigned Docker monitoring automatically sets the three labels `cmk/docker_image`,
`cmk/docker_image_name` and ` cmk/docker_image_version`.
You can use these labels, e.g. in conditions for your [wato_rules|rules], to make your monitoring configuration
dependent on the image used in a container.

== Files and directories

[cols=30, options="header"]
|===


|Path
|Function


|`tmp/check_mk/piggyback/`
|WATO stores the piggyback data here. For each host a subfolder with the host's
name will be generated. This contains a text file with the host's data.
The filename is the host that supplied the data.


|`tmp/check_mk/cache/`
|Here the most recent agent output from all hosts is saved temporarily.
The contents of a host's file is identical to that from the
`cmk -d myserver123` command.
