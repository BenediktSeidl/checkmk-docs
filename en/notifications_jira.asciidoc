[.seealso][#notifications]MT:Notifications via Jira

MD:The new integration of Jira in Checkmk enables the creation and closing of issues in monitoring.

== Introduction


image::bilder/jira_logo.png[align=float,left]

If you use the Jira software for error tracking, problem tracking, or project management,
from Version VERSION[1.6.0] of (CMK) Enterprise you can send notifications from (CMK) to Jira.

The following options are supported:

* Creation of [.guihints]#Issues# for host or service problems.
* Creation of issues with a defined [.guihints]#Priority}}# 
* Creation of issues with a defined [.guihints]#label}}# 
* Link to hosts/services in Checkmk from the generated Jira issues
* Set a [.guihints]#Resolution# in the issue on entering OK states


== Configuration

To set up the connection of (CMK) to Jira, you first have to create two new Fields in
Jira and determine certain Jira [.guihints]#IDs}}.# In addition the alerting program must be set up in (CMK).


=== Setting up the user-defined fields in Jira

When interacting with Jira (CMK) must know which alerts have already generated an issue,
and which have not. To make this possible you have to create two so-called [.guihints]#Custom fields}}# 
in Jira – i.e. user-defined fields.

To do this, as the administration user open the [.guihints]#Administration# item in the header bar in Jira.

image::bilder/jira_admin_settings.png[align=center,width=300]

Next select [.guihints]#Issues}},# and in the [.guihints]#Fields# section navigate to [.guihints]#Custom Fields}}.# 
[.guihints]#Add Custom Field# allows you to create a new, user-defined field.

In the next window please select [.guihints]#All}},# so that all field types
become visible.

Find the [.guihints]#Text Field (single line)# option, and press the [.guihints]#Next# button.

In the [.guihints]#Name# section enter the desired name – in our example `CMK_HOST_FIELD`.
You can optionally fill-out the [.guihints]#Description# with a description of the custom field.

Since we also need such a field for service notifications,
please repeat the procedure with a corresponding entry for services,
e.g. with the field name `CMK_SVC_FIELD`.

In order for CMK to create issues in Jira, you need the following Jira [.guihints]#IDs}}:# 

* Project ID
* Issuetype ID
* Priority ID
* Custom Host Field ID
* Custom Service Field ID

### Es gibt zwei Wege um diese [.guihints]#IDs# zu ermitteln.
### COMMENT[RB: sollten wir 1 hier eventuell ganz weglassen?)]
### H3:IDs über [.guihints]#Jira GUI# ermitteln (benötigt administrativen Account in Jira)

There are two ways to find these [.guihints]#IDs}}.# 

==== Identify IDs via the Jira [.guihints]#GUI# (requires administrator account in Jira)

Atlassian, the creater of Jira, provides its own procedure for this here:
<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-get-project-id-from-the-jira-user-interface-827341414.html">Instructions</a>.

==== Determining IDs via an external script

You can also query collected IDs with a script:

.example_script.py

----#!/usr/bin/env python

import requests
import sys
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

user = "JIRA_USERNAME"
password = "JIRA_PASSWORD"
project_key = "PROJECT_KEY"
jira_instance = "https://jira.server.your-domain.de"
custom_field_1 = "CMK_HOST_FIELD"
custom_field_2 = "CMK_SVC_FIELD"

def handle_response(user, password, jira_instance, what):
    url = "%s/rest/api/2/%s" % (jira_instance, what)
    sess = requests.Session()
    sess.auth = (user, password)
    response = sess.get(url, verify=False)

    return response

sys.stdout.write("=== IDs for project %s ===\n" % project_key)
infotext = ""
for section, id_name in [ ("Project_ID", "project"),
                          ("Issue", "issuetype"),
                          ("Priority", "priority"),
                          ("Field", "field"),
                        ]:

    json_response = handle_response(user,password,jira_instance,id_name).json()
    if id_name == "project":
        infotext = ""
        for project in json_response:
            if project["key"] == project_key:
                infotext += "%s\n\n" % project.get("id", "Project ID not found")
        if not infotext:
            infotext += "Project ID not found, project name existing?\n\n"
    else:
        types = ""
        for line in json_response:
            if id_name == "field":
                if line["name"].lower() == custom_field_1.lower() or \
                    line["name"].lower() == custom_field_2.lower():
                    types += "%s: %s\n" % (line["name"], line["id"].split("_")[1])
            else:
                types += "%s: %s\n" % (line["name"], line["id"])

        infotext += "=== %s types\n%s\n" % (section, types)

sys.stdout.write(infotext)
----

The output from the script looks like this:

[source,bash]
----

=== Setting-up the notifications in (CMK)

You have already learned how to set up alerts in the article [notifications|notifications].
To use Jira notifications select the notification method Jira (Enterprise only).

image::bilder/jira_notify_rule.png[align=border]

In the Jira [.guihints]#URL# field enter the URL of your Jira instance,
e.g. `jira.server.your-domain.com`.
At [.guihints]#User Name# and [.guihints]#Password# enter the user and password for access.

Now you need the previously determined IDs in the fields [.guihints]#Project ID# and [.guihints]#Issue type ID}}.# 
Enter the IDs of the custom fields created in Jira under [.guihints]#Host custom field ID# and [.guihints]#Service custom field ID}}.# 

In order to be able to link directly to (CMK) in the generated issues,
enter the URL of your (CMK) instance under [.guihints]#Monitoring URL# –
for example, `https://cmkserver/site`.

You can use the [.guihints]#Priority ID# option to define the priority with which the issues are created in Jira.

The description that is generated in the Issues for host and service problems can be changed
using the [.guihints]#Summary for host notifications# and the [.guihints]#Summary for service notifications# options.

Optionally, you can check the [.guihints]#Label# box to define whether during the Jira issue generation
you want to include Label with the transfer.

With ‘OK’ notifications, if you wish to have a [.guihints]#Resolution# entered into the Issue,
you can define this resolution via [.guihints]#Activate resolution with following resolution transition ID}}.# 
Jira has the following options:

* 11 - 'To Do'
* 21 - 'In Progress'
* 31 - 'Done'

[.guihints]#set optional timeout for connections to JIRA}}.# 
You can use [.guihints]#set optional timeout for connections to JIRA# to configure the timeout for connections to Jira.
If you do not define anything here a default timeout of 10 seconds will be assumed.
