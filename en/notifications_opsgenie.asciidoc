== Function

link:https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie[Opsgenie], now a part
of Atlassian, as an incident management platform provides alerting and
escalation for support teams, and can integrate many external tools, including
{CMK}. The basic connection requires only an API key and a URL, but you can also
specify other options in {CMK}, such as additional information depending on the
notification's source type.


== Configuring Opsgenie

You can find a short guide on how to integrate {CMK} directly within Opsgenie --
but this is based on an older {CMK} version where you had to pass a complete URL
including API key. In current versions, you enter the URL and key separately.
In addition, the URL is only required for accounts hosted in Europe.

. Create a team or call up an existing one.
. Choose the entry {CMK} under [.guihint]#Integrations/Add Integration#.
. In the displayed -- now incorrect instructions -- you will find a URL under [.guihint]#Paste#, including options and API key. Copy the domain part of the URL (https://api.eu.opsgenie.com).
. Next copy the API key and save the integration.


== Configuration in {CMK}

For the connection it is now sufficient to specify the two copied data in {CMK}:

. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method# choose the item [.guihint]#Opsgenie.#
. Enter the copied key in [.guihint]#API Key to use.#.
. Activate -- as an EU user -- the option [.guihint]#Domain#, and paste the copied domain there.

You can test the connection using the link:commands.html[commands], and set a host to
{DOWN} via [.guihint]#Fake check results#. The [.guihint]#Custom notification# function will not
generate an alert in Opsgenie at this point.

The configuration of the Opsgenie notification method provides you with all
kinds of additional options, especially for enriching and changing the default
contents of the notifications. In addition, you can use the [.guihint]#Responsible teams#
item to specify the Opsgenie team if you have not specifically integrated for
one team as described here, but for the entire Opsgenie account -- which is only
possible with certain subscriptions.
