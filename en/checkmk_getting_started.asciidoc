:title: In three minutes to the first monitored host
:description: The first steps in checkmk are done quickly. Following an installation, the first host requires only 3 steps to create.

After installing {CMK} -- either with one of our
link:cms_introduction_virt1.html[Appliances], or on your own
link:cms_introduction_packages.html[Linux server], and having
created your first monitoring instance (site), it is time to add devices.
In the following examples you will learn all about how to bring your site
to life -- we will assume that the site has been named `mysite`.

Tip: If you’re not sure how to use a specific function, in addition to the
handbook you can use the context-sensitive online help in the {CMK} overview.
You will find this at the top right, next to the {CMK} logo.

== Login on the Web-GUI

The default login URL is `http://HOSTNAME/mysite/` over the browser. The
user will be `cmkadmin`, and a random password was displayed at the end
of the installation process and should be noted. When using an appliance, you
will use the name and password you specified earlier when creating the instance.

== Installing a monitoring agent on the monitoring server

As the very first host, we will add the monitoring server itself.
The agent (_{CMK} Agent_) is preinstalled on {CMK} appliances.
When working with your own server you must install the agent yourself.
Select the [.guihint]#Monitoring Agents# option in the [.guihint]#WATO . Configuration#
element in the sidebar.

Now select -- depending on your distribution -- the RPM-, TGZ- or DEB-Package,
and install them on your monitoring server.  This is achieved as usual with
`gdebi`, `yum install` or `zypper install`.

== Adding a server to the monitoring

The management of the server and devices to be monitored can be found in the
[.guihint]#Hosts# menu option:

Go to [.guihint]#New host#, enter `localhost` as the host name,
and click on [.guihint]#Save &amp; go to Services#. In the following listing add
individual services with icon:icon_service_to_monitored[], or all services with
icon:button_monitor[].

On the screen that follows, click on the orange [.guihint]#2 changes# button, which
opens the next menu.  There click on the [.guihint]#Activate affected# button,
in order to activate the changes and to start the monitoring.

That’s it! The server will now be monitored with standard settings:

== Adding additional servers and network devices

You can add additional devices to your monitoring in the same way. Here are
a couple of tips:

* To monitor link:agent_windows.html[Windows], use the MSI packages which automatically install the _CheckMkService_ service.
* You can also monitor link:agent_snmp.html[SNMP devices] (switches, etc.).  For this, when configuring the host, in the _Host Tags_ submenu, select the _Agent Type_ option, and choose _SNMP (Networking Device, Appliance)_ in the drop down menu.  If your SNMP community is not `public`, then enter it in the _SNMP Community_ option.
* If the host name cannot be translated via DNS, activate the option [.guihint]#IPv4 Address# and enter the IP Address by hand in the appropriate field.
