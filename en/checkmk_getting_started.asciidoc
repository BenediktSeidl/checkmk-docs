You have installed {CMK} on a xref:install_packages#[Linux server].
Then you have created a xref:intro_setup#create_site[monitoring site] and xref:intro_setup#start_site[started the site].
In the following you will learn all about how to bring your site to life by adding the first devices to the monitoring.

If you are running {CMK} with one of our appliances or in a Docker container instead of on a Linux server, the software installation and site management will run slightly differently in detail: 
For the virtual appliance, the xref:introduction_virt1#[installation] and the xref:appliance_usage#site_management[creation of a site] are described in separate articles. 
With the xref:introduction_docker#[installation as Docker container], the site `cmk` is set up and started at the same time.

*Tip:* If you ever get stuck, we hope you will find the answer to your question in this User guide. If you have questions about details of the {CMK} interface, you can also display the context-sensitive online help: on the main page in the [.guihint]#Help# menu with [.guihint]#Help > Show inline help#.


[#login]
== Logging on to the Web-GUI

If your {CMK} server is called `myserver` and your site is called `mysite`, the web GUI is accessed with `\http://myserver/mysite/` in the browser:

When you created the site, the administrative {CMK} user `cmkadmin` was also created with a randomly generated password, which you noted down or also changed immediately. 

In the Docker container, the user is also called `cmkadmin`.
His password is in the xref:introduction_docker#login[log files of the container].
When using the appliance, you set the user name and password yourself when creating the site. 


[#install_agent]
== Installing an agent on the monitoring server

The very first host you include in the monitoring is the monitoring server itself.
To do this, you first need a monitoring agent. 

On the appliances this _{CMK} agent_ is already preinstalled.

When working with your own Linux server or in a Docker container you must install the agent yourself. You start in the navigation bar with the [.guihint]#Setup# menu.

In the {CEE}, [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX# takes you to the download page, which offers you a generic agent that you can download immediately:

In the {CRE}, [.guihint]#Setup > Agents > Linux# will take you to a similarly  download page.

Download the package file: 
Choose the RPM file format for Red Hat, CentOS and SLES or the DEB file format for Debian and Ubuntu. 
Then install the package on your {CMK} server. 
Depending on the Linux distribution, this is achieved with `yum install` (Red Hat, CentOS), `zypper install` (SLES) or `apt install` (Debian, Ubuntu). For detailed instructions on installing the agent, see the xref:intro_setup_monitor#install_agent[Beginner's guide].

*Tip:* To get information specific to a Docker container, the xref:monitoring_docker#install_agent_plugin[installation of the agent plugin] `mk_docker.py` is necessary in addition to the Linux agent.


[#add_server]
== Adding the server to the monitoring

The management of the hosts to be monitored can again be found in the [.guihint]#Setup# menu, more precisely under [.guihint]#Setup > Hosts > Hosts#.

Click on [.guihint]#Add host#, enter as [.guihint]#Hostname# 
`localhost` and click [.guihint]#Save &amp; go to service configuration#:

image::checkmk_getting_started_services_undecided.png[]

In this list, add all the services found but not yet monitored ('undecided') to the monitoring by clicking on [.guihint]#Monitor undecided services# or [.guihint]#Fix all#.

Then click on the orange button [.guihint]#2 changes# at the top right of the main page to activate the changes on the following page with [.guihint]#Activate on selected sites#. 
This takes the new host and its services from the configuration environment into the monitoring environment.

Thatâ€™s it!

The server will now be monitored with with default settings, which you can see if you display all hosts in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu with [.guihint]#Monitor > Overview > All hosts# and then select the new [.guihint]#localhost#:

[#add_more]
== Adding more servers and network devices

You can include additional devices to your monitoring in the same way. Here are
a couple of hints:

* To monitor xref:agent_windows#[Windows], use the agent in the MSI package. The Windows agent installs the 'Check MK Service' under Windows.

* To monitor xref:snmp#[SNMP devices] such as routers, switches, printers or hardware sensors, use the interface for monitoring already built in by the manufacturer: the SNMP agent. For this, when setting up the host for an SNMP device, select [.guihint]#No agent# as [.guihint]#Checkmk agent#. Instead, select as [.guihint]#SNMP# the [.guihint]#SNMP v2 or v3# value. If the SNMP community is not `public`, then enter it under [.guihint]#SNMP credentials#.

* If the host name cannot be resolved via DNS, activate the [.guihint]#IPv4 address# parameter in the host properties and enter the IP address by hand.
