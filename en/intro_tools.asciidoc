:title: The monitoring tools
:description: Important tools for monitoring with {CMK} are the snapins of the sidebar, such as Overview and Master Control, and the Monitor menu. These topics will be covered in this chapter of the {CMK} Beginner's guide,, which will guide you through the first steps for setting up IT monitoring with {CMK} in an optimal way.

[#status_interface]
== Status interface

Now that we have finally given our monitoring system something to do, it is time
to take a closer look at the elements of the {CMK} user interface that help you
in your daily monitoring or operating life. In {CMK}, this component is sometimes
called the *status interface* because it is mostly concerned with displaying
the current status of all hosts and services. This includes dashboards and views
that you call up via the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, the snapins in the sidebar,
as well as the display and processing of performance metrics.


[#overview]
== Overview

Prominently placed at the top of the sidebar you will find the [.guihint]#Overview# snapin:

image::overview_less.png[width=50%]

In the left column of this small table you will first see the number of hosts and
services you are monitoring. The third row shows [.guihint]#Events#. These only become
relevant for you if you have configured the monitoring of messages. This means,
for example, messages from syslog, SNMP traps and log files.
For this, {CMK} has its own very powerful module, which will be discussed in detail in the article of the same name: the link:ec.html[Event Console].

The right column shows the number of problems that have not yet been acknowledged.
Problems are objects that are currently in {WARN}/{CRIT}/{UNKNOWN} or {DOWN}/{UNREACH} status.
_Acknowledgement_ is a way of 'taking note' of a problem.

You can click on the number in a cell to get a list of the objects that have been
counted here. This works for all cells in the [.guihint]#Overview#, by the way.

In the [.guihint]#Overview# you can also decide whether you want to
see less or more information.
With the icon:button_showmore[] button you can switch to the Show more mode:

image::overview_more.png[width=50%]

Between the two previously visible columns, the new second column now shows the
count for *all* problems, i.e. with the addition of those that have already
been acknowledged. In our example, the numbers in the second and third columns
are identical because we have not yet acknowledged any problem.

Finally, the last column on the far right shows the hosts or services whose
information is 'out of date' -- _Stale_ -- because no up-to-date monitoring
data is currently available for them. If, for example, a host is not currently
accessible, {CMK} cannot retrieve any information from its services. However, this does
not automatically mean that the services have a problem. Therefore, {CMK} does
not simply assume a new status for these services, instead it sets them to the
pseudo status 'Stale'. The column [.guihint]#Stale# will be omitted by {CMK} from the
display if it would only show a 0 in all cases.


[#monitor_menu]
== Monitor menu

Your basic toolbox for completing all monitoring tasks is the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu,
which you can open via the navigation bar:

image::monitor_menu_less.png[]

In this menu you will find the tools that will provide you with answers to your
monitoring questions. The menu is subdivided according to _topics_.
You will find the menu items listed below each topic.

After selecting one of the entries in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu, the requested
information is usually displayed on the main page either as a
dashboard or as a view -- each of
which we will cover in more detail in this article.

*Note:* You can also load the contents of the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu into the
sidebar -- as a snapin with the title [.guihint]#Views#. This snapin is not included in
the sidebar by default. But you can simply add it to the sidebar by clicking
icon:button_sidebar_add_snapin[] from the list of available snapins.


[#dashboards]
== Dashboards

A dashboard presents the most important information on a topic on a single page,
such as the answer to the question "What is the status of my {CMK} site?"
Different visualizations of data are used and combined in a dashboard, such as views,
history graphs, tables, diagrams and many other elements. The aim is to present
the information from different perspectives to you in such a way that you can
grasp the essentials quickly and are not distracted by unnecessary details.

{CMK} provides several preconfigured dashboards that you can open from the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu: the [.guihint]#Main#, the [.guihint]#{CMK}# and the [.guihint]#Problem# dashboard:

image::dashboard_problem.png[]

If one of these dashboards is displayed, you can quickly switch to the others: in the menu bar to the right of the [.guihint]#Help# menu you will find the icons for the available dashboards. You can also promote the currently displayed one to [.guihint]#Main dashboard#: in the menu [.guihint]#Dashboard > Set as start URL#.

{cre-only}
The [.guihint]#Main# dashboard of the {EE}, which shows the state of the site, is not included in the {RE}. In the {RE}, the [.guihint]#Main# dashboard is the [.guihint]#Problem# dashboard of the {EE}.

A special feature of the {CMK}
dashboards is that by using an intelligent algorithm they automatically adapt to
the available screen dimensions and make optimal use of the screen size.

You can also use the individual elements of a dashboard, the so-called
*Dashlets*, to adapt existing dashboards and create new ones. You can learn
all the relevant details for this in the link:dashboards.html[article on the dashboards].


[#views]
== Views

A view is a predefined status view in the form of a table that shows you the
current status of hosts, services or other objects from a specified perspective.

Such a view can have a context -- for example, if it shows all of the
services running on the `mycmkserver` host. Other views work globally -- for example,
the view that shows you all of the services that currently have a problem.

All of the *global* views can be opened from the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu,
below the respective topic, for instance [.guihint]#All Hosts#, [.guihint]#Service problems# or
[.guihint]#{CMK} sites#. After clicking on one of these menu items, the corresponding
view is displayed in the main page -- in the following example [.guihint]#Service problems#:

image::view_service_problems.png[]

In a view you have numerous control options, among others:

* You can navigate to other views by clicking on specific cells -- such as the host name or one of the services in the above example.
* By clicking on a column's title, you can sort by that column.
* The menu [.guihint]#Display > Modify display options# shows some settings for customising the view. In the [.guihint]#Number of columns# list you can change the number of columns displayed -- e.g. to make full use of your wide screen -- and in the [.guihint]#Refresh interval# list you can set the number of seconds after which the view is automatically reloaded -- after all, status data can change at any time.
* You can reduce the number of table entries after clicking [.guihint]#Filter# with the *filter bar* -- which is not really necessary in the example shown, but which is very helpful with long tables.

We will introduce the filter bar with a very simple example. From the list of all
services, we will filter out those with 'cpu' in their name. Click on the total
number of services in the link:intro_tools.html#overview[Overview]. On the main page,
all services will then be displayed in the [.guihint]#All services# view.
Click the [.guihint]#Filter# button in the action bar. The filter bar will appear on
the right hand side of the main page.
In the [.guihint]#Service# input field, enter `cpu` and click [.guihint]#Apply filters#:

image::view_service_filter.png[]

With the filter applied, we have reduced the number of displayed services to two.

The filter bar is a very powerful way of customising views to meet your needs.
The filter criteria are always context-specific and therefore match the content
of the currently-displayed view. The example above shows only some of the
criteria available for filtering services. If the default selection is not enough
for you, you can use [.guihint]#Add filter# to show even more criteria and add them to the filter bar.

The filter bar is also used for the search items in the [.guihint]#Monitor# menu,
such as [.guihint]#Host search# or [.guihint]#Service search#. When you select one of these
search items, an empty view with an open filter bar is displayed in which
you can search according to the filter criteria.

Once you have tailored the filter to show exactly what you are interested in,
you can save this customised view as a bookmark -- which brings us to the
next topic: bookmarks.

*Note:* The views have many more possibilities -- both for
customisation and for creating your own views. You can find out how to do this
in the link:views.html[article on views].

[#bookmarks]
== Bookmarks

For web pages that you visit again and again, you can create bookmarks in the
sidebar with the [.guihint]#Bookmarks# snapin.

Do you really need these? After all, there are bookmarks in the Web browser.
Well, the {CMK} bookmarks have a couple of advantages of their own:

* A called bookmark only changes the content on the main page without reloading the sidebar.
* You can share bookmarks with other users.
* When setting bookmarks, the re-execution of actions is automatically prevented.

At first, the Bookmarks snapin is still empty:

image::empty_bookmarks.png[width=50%]

If you now click [.guihint]#Add Bookmark#, a new bookmark will be created for the content
currently displayed on the main page:

image::bookmarks.png[width=50%]

Your personal bookmarks are stored under [.guihint]#My Bookmarks#. 

If you want to go deeper into this subject, for instance, how to share a bookmark
list with other users, you can do so in the link:user_interface.html#bookmarks[article on the user interface].


[#master_control]
== Master control

In the [.guihint]#Master control# snapin on the sidebar, you can switch various monitoring
functions off and on again individually, such as the [.guihint]#Notifications#.
This latter is very useful if you are carrying out major modifications to the
system and do not want to annoy your colleagues with unnecessary messages.

image::master_control.png[width=50%]

*Important:* Make sure that all switches are set to *on* during normal
operation, otherwise important monitoring functions may be switched off.

[#metrics]
== Performance metrics

The vast majority of the services not only provide a status, but also performance metrics.
Let's take the service that checks the file system `C:` on a Windows server as an example:

image::filesystem_c.png[]

In addition to the {OK} status, we can see that approximately, of the file system's
total of 50 GByte, 38 GB has been used -- which is around 76%.
You can see this information in the [.guihint]#Summary# column. The most important value
in this case -- the percentage -- is also visualised on the right-hand side in
the [.guihint]#Perf-O-Meter# column.

But this is only a rough overview. A more detailed table of all of the performance
metrics for a service can be found by clicking on the service in its detailed
view in the [.guihint]#Service Metrics# line:

image::service_metrics.png[]

But even more interesting is that by default {CMK} automatically retains the
chronological sequence of all such performance metrics for up to four years -- in
the so-called link:graphing.html#rrds[RRD files]. All values for the latest 48 hours are
stored by the minute. The chronology is displayed in graphs like this one,
as it is shown for the [.guihint]#Check_MK# service in the {CEE}:

image::example_graph.png[]

Here are a few tips for what you can do with these graphs:

* Point the mouse cursor into the graph and a 'tooltip' will show the precise readings for the current time.
* You can zoom into the timeline with the mouse wheel.
*  Click with the left mouse button anywhere on the graph and drag to the left or right to change the displayed time interval.
* Drag up or down while holding the left mouse button to zoom into the vertical axis.
* With the icon:resize_graph[] icon in the bottom right corner you can resize the graph.

There is also a system for displaying graphs in the {CRE}.
This is based on the Nagios add-on PNP4Nagios and is not interactive.

The system for recording, evaluating and displaying performance data in {CMK} can
do much more -- especially in the {CEE}. Details on this can be found
in the link:graphing.html[article on performance data and graphing].
