== Function

<a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a> is a simple service to send
messages from various sources to Apple or Android mobile devices, where they
appear as _notifications_. On the desktop, the messages can be received via
the browser.
The connection is established via two API keys for a group and an app/source.


== Configuring Pushover

In Pushover you need to create both a group, even if you only have one 'group',
and an app explicitly for {CMK} -- each receives their own API key:

. Create a new group with at least one member via [.guihint]#Create a Group# in Pushover.
. Copy the displayed Group API key.
. Create an app with any name via [.guihint]#Create an Application/API Token.#
. Copy the displayed App API key.


== Configuration in {CMK}

In {CMK} it is generally sufficient to specify the two keys:
. For the [.guihint]#Notification Method}} choose the item {{Push Notifications (using Pushover).#
. Specify the App-API key under [.guihint]#API Key#.
. Specify the Group API Key in [.guihint]#User/Group Key#.

You can optionally activate the [.guihint]#Priority}} and {{Select sound# pushover
functions. You can use the priority function to override rest periods configured
in Pushover -- and then accompany such alarms with appropriate sounds.

For testing you can use the [.guihint]#Fake check results#
and [.guihint]#Custom notification# link:commands.html[commands].
